## Collections Framework
> Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque etc.) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet etc).

- [Lecture Notes](lecture-notes/Java_Collection.docx)

- Readymade architecture, no need to implement functions

- `ArrayList` uses an `Object[]`, and makes a bigger array when the array gets full.
